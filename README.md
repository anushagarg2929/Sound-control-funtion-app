# Sound-control-function-app

This is a basic audio player app in which you can listen audios and pause it if any kind of disturbance come in between and can move it backward to watch that part again.
There is also one slider present to control the volume of the audio and another slider for showing where the audio has reached and we can track it through this slider as soon as we touch this slider the audio stops and as we leave it starts working again.
